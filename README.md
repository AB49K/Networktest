# Networktest
Short and sweet script to test throughput on a network.

Usage:
Copy networktestserver.py to a target machine on your network, start it.

Run networktest.py

example: python networktest.py --target=192.168.1.10 --threads=8

Monitor network load using tools such as nload.

Runs on port 3333, open that up on your firewall.
